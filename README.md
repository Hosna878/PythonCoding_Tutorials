# PythonCoding_Tutorials
Small functions that would summarize what is needed for python coding

There are 5 Tutorials starting with Tutorial1 to start coding with Python and finishing with Tutorial5. There are also two fun mini scripts one for piglatin and the other for easter day.
Look at the codes and try to make functions like these on your own.
Do not forget that half of coding is problem solving and the other half is undrestanding codes written by others.
